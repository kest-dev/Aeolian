</div>

Aeolian puts the user at control of their music library. Allowing streaming as well as organizing them into a playlist. This application is an open-source alternative to various different music library and streaming services. Inspired by [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin). Users can also host a BopParty, allowing multiple users to listen to the same music in-sync.

# !!! This application is still in heavy development !!!
